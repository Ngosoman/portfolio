      Cars have always been more than just machines to me they are rolling
      pieces of art if not engineering marvels. Furthermore they are a symbol of
      freedom. Ever since a small boy, I have always been fascinated by the
      sound of engines, the sleek designs and all the way to the advancing and
      innovation behind each model. I love exploring how they work and what
      actually makes each one unique. My passion for cars often inspires my
      creativity, even in software engineering, where I aim for the same balance
      of performance and style.
